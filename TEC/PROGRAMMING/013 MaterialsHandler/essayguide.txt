Introduction 

	As many paragraphs and you need.
	Friendly comments that are hard to disagree on.
	Objectivity over subjectivity
	At the end, make you statement
Supporting
	Each paragraph must have citations
	These are support, not making up things	
Conclusion
	If the conclusion is better than the argument, restate the argument
	Put the conclusion at the first paragraph once written.
	Then elaborate another conclusion to close the thing

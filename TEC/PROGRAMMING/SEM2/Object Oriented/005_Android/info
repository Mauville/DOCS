You are asked to create a simulator of an android.

For this, you need to store the number of steps. Additionally, store its current position (as x, y coordinates),
and orientation (north, south, east, west). Besides, it is equipped with two sensors: one to measure
the capacity of the battery, and another to measure its temperature.  The former sensor has an initial capacity,
and every certain number of steps given by the robot, this capacity is diminished. When the battery capacity reaches a lower
limit, the robot most recharge its battery.The latter sensor, stores the current robot’s temperature and the number of
steps required to increase 1°C. It also has a temperature limit. When this is reached the robot most stop for 2 minutes
to cool down.
All the sensors can check up its status to determine if the robot can keep on working. They can also register a step
given by the robot, and display its internal status. The android has a method to move to a given position, but
the android can only walk in a straight line or turn 90° clock wise or counter clock wise.
Build the class diagram, and implement the code. Display log information for every action performed by the robot

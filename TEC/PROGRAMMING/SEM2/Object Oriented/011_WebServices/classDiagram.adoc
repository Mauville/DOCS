== Problem
A cloud computing enterprise has multiple services to sale or rent. They sale Internet add-ons, and rent web applications and web hosting spots.  +
Every service has a base price from which its sale or rent price is determined according to the following rules:

** Internet add-ons
*** Its price is 20% of the base price if itâ€™s the first time the service is acquired, or 10% of the base price if the service has been previously bought.

** Rented applications
*** The monthly rate is 1% of the base price if the software was released this year; 0.9% if was released on the previous 3 years; 0.8% if was released more than 3 years ago.

** Hosted applications
*** The monthly rate depends on the disk space utilized and on the downloaded bits
*** If it uses less than 100Mb the payment is for 1% of the base price. 0.5% of the base price is additionally charged per each extra 100Mb.
*** If the downloaded bits are less than 1000 Mb, the rate is 2% of the base price. 1% of the base price is additionally charged per each extra 1000 Mb.

== Instructions

    * Build a class diagram
    * Implement the classes
    * Build a demo class to show each service working

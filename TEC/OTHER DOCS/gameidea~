horror gaem 
chased by enemies
hiding in common spots
my house

first starts as fps
then turns to a walking jumpong sim
first ghost is woman with extensible nails
ghosts talk over while they chase you
first one is actually unbeatable
you habe ot  google the solution
literally google it at the machine while being chased
solution is cutting its nails while hiding
after that, hide in the closet that sounds like chainsaws
closet doesnt close totally
through crack, alien like enemy pops his giant head
tells you that he can see your litle hiding spots
hes actually a midget
like the half life final enemies
chase ensues
drop down the stairs
go into kitchen
climb up cupboard
thing jumps but cant reach you
hit it with different things
banana
sock
finally spatula
thing receeds for a while, splattered over a while
calmn down
thing starts moving and talking again
now has a fast but not squeaky voice
starts jumping around like madman
attacks you by jumping
in its blabbery he tells you how good the pringles were
he also tells you theres some lasagna in the oven, only lacking the cheese
prngles are cheese flavored
finish game by opening oven, throwing pringles in and closing the door just after the enemy jumps after them
